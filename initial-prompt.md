When using the cursor IDE, many times codes get's much better, but then, just before reaching an optimal level, Cursor performs lots of actions, and code get's far from the original intention.
I wish to have a very simple way to create a "Milestone" (including a serial number and an optional note) (under the hood this will simply be a git-add-commit-push) 
I want to build a Visual Studio code plugin. Purpose of this plugin is to reflect which milestone I'm on, allow me to very easily (optional note, button click) create a milestone, and just as easily (select from a drop down) go back to a saved milestone.
Plugin should display current milestone in the status bar, and have a left panel and icon to revert to past milestone.
